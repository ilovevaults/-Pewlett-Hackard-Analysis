# -Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Goals
The goal of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees in each department and to determine which employees are eligible for the company's mentorship program. Based on the number of retiring employees who are eligible for the mentorship the company will decide which department needs the most new employees.
## Results
-Based on the results, both the senior staff and senior engineer titles have the most number of employees leaving 
-While the assisant engineer title and the manager title both have the least amount of staff leaving. 
-The manager title has the very least amount of employees leaving with just 2. 
-Both the staff and technique leader titles are in the middle with 7636 and 3603 employees respectively 
### Summary
In total there will be 72,458 positions will need to filled throughout all of the titles before these employees will start to retire and only 2% are eligible for the mentorship program.
In terms of having enough employees in the mentorship program all of the titles except for both the assistant engineer and technique leader have more than 100 eligible employees but at the same time both of these titles have a lesser amount of employees retiring. 
To sum it all up there are not enough retirement ready and mentorship program eligible employees to train the future employees. One solution would be give incentives for more employees to stay with the company and another solution would be to increase the eligibility of being part of the mentorship program.
